```

### Installation Steps
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed
3. Install the required dependencies
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment

## 📖 Usage

### Generating Company Data

1. Open `HS_Companies_Data_Generator.ipynb`
2. Run all cells to generate 1,000 company records
3. The script will automatically export data to `companies.csv`
4. Customize the `num_records` variable to generate more or fewer records

### Generating Contact Data

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a company data CSV file (generated by the companies script)
2. Open `HS_Contact_data_generator.ipynb`
3. Update the CSV filename in the script to match your company data file
4. Run all cells to generate 1,000 contact records
5. The script will:
   - Read existing company data
   - Generate contact records linked to companies
   - Merge company and contact data
   - Export the merged dataset as `hs_acc-con_data1.csv`

### Customization Options

#### Adjusting Record Counts
```python
# In both notebooks, modify this variable
num_records = 1000  # Change to desired number
```

#### Modifying Data Ranges
```python
# Company employee count range
num_employees = random.randint(20, 5000)

# Annual revenue range
annual_revenue = random.randint(100000, 500000000)
```

#### Adding Custom Industries
```python
# Add to the industries list in the companies script
industries = ['Your Custom Industry', ...]
```
